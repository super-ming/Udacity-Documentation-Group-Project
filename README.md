# Udacity-Documentation-Group-Project
For participants in the Grow with Google Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev program to practice their coding sills and wrap their heads around Javascript. 
<h2> Motivation </h2>
The best way to learn is to be forced to teach others, so this project aims at giving newbies an opportunity to code, collaborate via Git, and teach others parts of Javascript. If you are just stumbling upon this and want to contribute, we encourage you to do so.

<h2> Individual Contribution</h4>
<h3> First...a few things</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to have a text editor installed  (ie. Atom or Sublime)</li>
  <li>Install git on your computer. If you've never used Git, take the time to go through <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775" target="_blank"> Udacity's Intro to Git and Github </a> course to learn how to use it. A lot of the reason for this project is to give newbies a chance to learn how to collaborate, so do yourself a favor and take the time to finish that three lesson course.</li>
  <li>Frameworks in use on this project include Bootstrap 4 and JQuery 3.3.1</li>
</ul>
  <h3> So, what are you contributing?</h4>
  <p> The goal is to give you an opportunity to code, collaborate, and convey. By convey I mean, convey your knowledge of a part of Javascript by teaching others about it. We never truly know something until we know it so well we can teach others about it. So, you are to take a topic and find a way to explain it to the average simpleton. Yes, you'll need to include the technical explanation for how to implement your topic, but you should strive to find a way to teach this using Plain English and examples that help illustrate the main points. If you participate in that Udacity Intro to Git and Github course you'll see them use recipes as an illustration for how to teach concepts that are quite complex. That is a great example of what we're looking for. Start from square one, and help the reader understand what you understand.</p>
  <h3>I've thought it out...I know what to do...how do I contribute now?</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>1- Create a fork of the current repository to get started on the project. Then, be sure to create a branch of the master for making your changes. </li>
<li>2- On index.html, be sure to add your topic in the navigation bar, following alphabetic order, and link it to your page.</li>
  <li> For the sake of simplicity, I don't believe we need too many individual comments added into the index.html, since you're mostly only adding a link to your page. But, on your indidividual pages please include comments in your code.</li>
  <li>3- Be sure to use commit messages to show the changes you make to your branched version of index.html.</li>
<li>4- Working off of the template-page.html, write the code for your page.</li>
<li>5- Retitle this new page following the pattern of topic-name-page (ie. "foreach-page.html", or "for-loop-page.html").</li>
  <li> 6- Make sure your page uses the stylesheet.css and if your page needs individual elements not currently found then please make those additions with commit messages detailing your additions.</li>
<li>6- Make a Pull Request to initiate discussion about your commits. </li>
<li> 7- Wait for comments from the team reviewing the submissions to ensure the style pages are consistent.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Directory Structure</h4>
Each "page" should go in the Topics folder. When writing your code, be sure to use relative links.

<h4> Conclusion</h4>
If anything is false or not clear, feel free to contact me or open an issue in GitHubm, or create a reply on our Udacity Forum.

  <li>Frameworks in use on this project include Bootstrap 4 and JQuery 3.3.1</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting Up the Repository</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the “Fork” button to create your own copy of the repository.</li>
  <li>Open a command prompt in Windows, a terminal in Linux, or (whatever someone opens in Mac).</li>
  <li>Go to your working projects directory.</li>
  <li>To clone the repo using SSH, use the command:
    git clone git@github.com:yourUserName/Udacity-Documentation-Group-Project.git</li>
  <li>To clone the repo using HTTPS, use the command:
    git clone https://github.com/dalumiller/Udacity-Documentation-Group-Project.git</li>
  <li>This command creates a subdirectory named after the repo in the your working projects directory.</li>
  <li>Create a new branch to work on:
    git checkout -b branchName</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>I've thought it out...I know what to do...how do I contribute now?</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Create a fork of the current repository to get started on the project. Then, be sure to create a branch of the master for making your changes. </li>
  <li>Take the html in template.html and copy it into a new html page titled your topic title. Save that into the topics file.</li>
  <li>Do not change the code on the template.html, but in your newly created html copied from template, go ahead and enter your code and explanation of the topic.</li>
<li>We need to link your topic page to the rest of the project. In the index.html file, add your topic in the navigation bar (using alphabetic order) and link it to your page.</li>
  <li>Adding navigation to your topic will also need to be added to all of the individual topic pages, as well as the topic-autocomplete.js</li>
  <li> For the sake of simplicity, I don't believe we need too many individual comments added into the index.html, since you're mostly only adding a link to your page. But, on your indidividual pages please include comments in your code.</li>
  <li>Be sure to use commit messages to show the changes you make to your branched version of index.html.</li>

<li> Wait for comments from the team reviewing the submissions to ensure the style pages are consistent.</li>
